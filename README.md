A Java implementation of a .txt file encoder and decoder 
using Huffman Trees.

The HuffmanDriver.java file is used to create the run the
encoder/decoder, while the other files are used to create
the structure for the program. HuffmanTree.java creates the
Huffman Tree structure. HuffmanCodes.java is used to encode a
.txt file using the Huffman Tree, and HuffmanDecode.java is
used to decode that encoded file.
