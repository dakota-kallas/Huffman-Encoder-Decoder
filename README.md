A Java implementation of a .txt file encoder and decoder 
using Huffman Trees.

The HuffmanDriver.java file is used to create the run the
encoder/decoder, while the other files are used to create
the structure for the program. HuffmanTree.java creates the
Huffman Tree structure. HuffmanCodes.java is used to encode a
.txt file using the Huffman Tree, and HuffmanDecode.java is
used to decode that encoded file.

The book files provided are test examples of what the program does, 
with book1 being the user provided .txt file, book1.enc being the
encoded version of the user provided .txt file, and book1NEW.txt
being the decoded version of book1.txt.
