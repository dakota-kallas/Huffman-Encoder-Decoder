# Huffman .txt File Encoder/Decoder

Java implementation of a .txt file encoder and decoder using Huffman Trees.

## Files

- HuffmanDriver.java - used to run the encoder/decoder
- HuffmanTree.java - creates the Huffman Tree structure
- HuffmanCodes.java - encodes a .txt file using the Huffman Tree
- HuffmanDecode.java - decodes the encoded .txt file
- Book files - serves as examples to showcase the program's ability to encode and decode .txt files

## Usage

Run `HuffmanDriver.java` to encode/decode .txt files using Huffman Trees.

### Installing

Clone this repository to your local machine:
`$ git clone https://github.com/dakota-kallas/Huffman-Encoder-Decoder.git`

## Example

Provided book files (`book1.txt`, `book1.enc`, `book1NEW.txt`, etc.) serve as an example of the program's functionality.
